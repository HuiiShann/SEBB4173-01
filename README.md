# Cell and Molecular Biology for Bioinformatics
ðŸ’— Course code: SEBB 4173 

ðŸ’—Academic Session/Semester: 2024/2025 - 1


### Course Information ðŸŒ 
This subject will facilitate students to understand and visualize processes in cell
biology and those responsible for DNA transmission and expression hence
mechanisms by which bacteria inherit genetic information as the blue print of life.
The lectures will explain relationship between structure and function in molecular
biology and how this relationship operates to control biochemical processes. Topics
include macromolecules like DNA, RNA and proteins and how processes like
replication, transcription and translation operate, eukaryotic genetics. Students will
cover related aspects such as mutation and mutagenesis, effects of mutation and how
cells overcome mutation. Students will also learn about basic techniques in molecular
biology as the basis for genetic engineering. Presentation by each group will be done
at the end of the semester on designated topics. ðŸ§¬
